# Creating a CD system

Previous: [Part 1- Setup](/blog/post/homelab/setup)

After some research I decided to use Argo CD for a CD system.  It seems to work well for observing the 
cluster state and defining the manifests that will be used.

```yaml title="continued_install.sh"
helm repo add argo https://argoproj.github.io/argo-helm && helm repo update

helm install argocd argo/argo-cd \
  --namespace argocd \
  --create-namespace \
  -f argocd/values.yaml

kubectl get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -n argocd   -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d

kubectl apply -f app_of_apps.yaml -n argocd
```

Argo works by creating Application and ApplicationSet custom resources that are monitored by Argo.  Each 
application will define a resource to pull and monitor, which will be shown in the dashboard.  I started with 
creating the base application (app_of_apps in the install).  This monitors the folder in my GitOps repo that contains 
itself and my other application definitions.  Each other application in this folder will define a source to create 
and monitor.

Some applications require separate ingresses to access the services so that I can properly use 
tailscale-operator on them, so I defined them in a kustomization separately.  Example-

```yaml title="argocd-apps/longhorn.yaml"
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: longhorn
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  project: default
  source:
    repoURL: repourl
    targetRevision: HEAD
    path: apps/longhorn
  destination:
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
    namespace: longhorn-system
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
      selfHeal: true
    syncOptions:
      - CreateNamespace=true
```

<br />

```yaml title="apps/longhorn/kustomization.yaml"
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

helmCharts:
  - name: longhorn
    repo: https://charts.longhorn.io
    version: 1.8.1
    releaseName: longhorn
    namespace: longhorn-system
    valuesFile: values.yaml # some tweaks here

resources:
  - ingress.yaml # same as others
```
