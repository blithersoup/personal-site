# Setting Up Postgresql and Minio Object Storage

For this step I added the minio and postgresql helm charts to my argocd repo.  Overall 
I was able to install without a problem, but learned some of the difficulties of working 
with helm charts.

## Postgres

```yaml title="apps/postgres/values.yaml"
primary:
  persistence:
    storageClass: "longhorn"
    enabled: true
    size: 10Gi
  resources:
    requests:
      memory: "512Mi"
      cpu: "250m"
    limits:
      memory: "1Gi"
      cpu: "500m"
readReplicas:
  replicaCount: 1
  persistence:
    storageClass: "longhorn"
    enabled: true
    size: 10Gi
  resources:
    requests:
      memory: "512Mi"
      cpu: "250m"
    limits:
      memory: "1Gi"
      cpu: "500m"
metrics:
  enabled: true
  serviceMonitor:
    enabled: true
    labels:
      release: kube-prometheus-stack
```

With the above values file, we generate primary and secondary replicas with longhorn 
PVCs.

```yaml title="argocd-apps/minio.yaml"
mode: standalone
replicas: 1
persistence:
  enabled: true
  storageClass: longhorn
  size: 600Gi
consoleIngress:
  enabled: false
resources:
  requests:
    memory: 6Gi
metrics:
  serviceMonitor:
    enabled: true
    additionalLabels:
      release: kube-prometheus-stack
buckets:
  - name: mlflow
    policy: none
    purge: false
  - name: music
    policy: none
    purge: false
```

For minio I first configured a high availability setup but determined that using 
extra storage on 2 nodes would have limited benefit.  I did not have much difficulty 
with this part other than configuring the service monitor release.

As for auth, I searched for solutions for a while and decided that I just did not want to 
implement anything special as my services are only accessible over a private subnet.
