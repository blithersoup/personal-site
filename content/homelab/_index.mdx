# Homelab

This is documentation of my homelab, which is a two node kubernetes 
cluster that hosts some services that I intend to use.  I have repurposed 
my x86_64 desktop with an Intel i7 CPU, 16GB ram, and a NVIDIA 3070 for the 
primary node and purchased a Raspberry Pi 5 16GB (expensive I know) for the 
secondary due to its support of my spare 1TB NVMe SSD.

The goal of this project was to learn more about kubernetes, GitOps, networking, and 
of course host some services.  By getting this far I believe I have accomplished all 
of this.

In short, the cluster deploys and supervises applications with 
[ArgoCD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/) that are defined in 
[this repo](https://github.com/blithersoup/private-cloud-1).  I also have 
[Hubble](https://github.com/cilium/hubble) for observing network flows and 
[Grafana / Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/visualization/grafana/)
for gathering and viewing metrics.  The main applications I use (and started 
this project to host) are [Minio](https://min.io/) and [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/).

I considered implementing a more highly available and fault tolerant setup, but determined 
that the benefits would not be worth the extra setup and buying extra hardware, at 
least for now.

For this project, learning the technology and understanding how the configuration worked 
was far more difficult than reasoning about the system and creating solutions.  Overall 
I am happy with the end result and would be interested in designing a more involved system.
Below are the (dry) writeups that I made while learning.
