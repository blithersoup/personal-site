# Weekend in the Bay

April 19, 2025

I recently spent a weekend in the bay area with my friend Carter 
and it was truly fantastic.

We began the weekend by surfing in Pacifica.

The waves weren't the best, but the views were awesome and afterwards 
we ate at the most scenic Taco Bell.

We retired to Cupertino for dinner and got up the next day for a run with 
Maxim.

We ran up a fair bit of elevation to see very nice views of the south bay.
Then, Carter and I headed to San Francisco to visit the Gregangelo 
museum.  It was a good experience and afterwards we met with Maxim to see 
the city and drive across the Golden Gate Bridge.

We then drove downtown and had dinner in the marina district.  The next day 
we mountain biked at Soquel Demo forest in Santa Cruz.  We rode 
[this](https://www.mtbproject.com/trail/675422/braille-flow) route, which 
was pretty intense.  After a long gravel climb, we hit braille, which 
was a very steep mile-long downhill tech trail.  We then hit the top again 
and went down flow trail, another excellent downhill.

Overall this was an amazing trip, I'll have to come back sometime!
