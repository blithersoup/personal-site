# Spring Break Trip to Tioman Island, Malaysia

March 19, 2023

This blog details the first part of my spring break where I went on a trip to 
Tioman Island in Malaysia.

I got picked up at around 2am from my dorm by van.  The roads were completely 
empty, and it took about five hours to get to the port in mainland Malaysia.

I took a nap for about an hour until it was time to depart, and then boarded the ferry.

As it was still monsoon season, the ocean was very choppy; it seemed like the ferry moved 
up and down five feet with each wave.

After landing on the island, we met with our driver for the weekend and headed to a resort nearby.  
We were traveling with another group that was staying where we arrived for the weekend, so we set 
down our belongings and had lunch at a nearby chinese restaurant.  We then took a short drive to the 
jetty that we would soon depart from.

We then took an hour-long boat ride around the island to dragon horn.

After the boat ride, we arrived at a village and walked through to the base of the mountain.

We then hiked up the mountain, and the highest point that we reached was the last grassy point between 
the peaks.

After we hiked back down, we took a boat back to where we started on the island, collected our things, 
and took the truck across the island to where we would stay for the next two nights.  We then settled 
into our suite and had some western food.  I then went to sleep early.

The next day, we started the day by walking the beach.  One part was very rocky and had ponds with fish 
that got washed up during high tide.

We then walked past a few resorts that were mostly empty because it was between dive and surf seasons.  
There was a sea turtle conservancy nearby, which was interesting.  We had some snacks, and then played in 
the ocean for a bit; as expected, the waves were substantial.

We then headed back to our resort and started the barbeque

After dinner was finished, we headed to a beach nearby for some ice cream and stargazed before going to bed.

The next day, I woke up early and then headed back across the island with the group.  We departed from a nearby 
jetty to go snorkeling, which I did not get any pictures of.  I saw a coral reef and even some characters from 
Finding Nemo!  Also, apparently the king of Malaysia was on the island the day that we were there, so we saw some 
helicopters flying overhead a few times.  The group then headed back and hung out for a bit before getting on the 
ferry back to the mainland.

Once on the mainland, we had a family style dinner at a Chinese restaurant.  The staff was very friendly, and the 
food we had was great.  Halfway through, as it was going to rain in an hour, there was a cloud of bugs that descended 
on the restaurant.  The bugs were everywhere for a few minutes until a flock of birds cleared them out.  After dinner, 
we waited for the van and headed back into Singapore.

Overall, it was a lovely trip and I had a great time.
