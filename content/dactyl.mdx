# Finishing My Dactyl Manuform

Today I finished my 
[Dactyl Manuform](https://github.com/abstracthat/dactyl-manuform)
, which is a split, concave, ortholinear hand wired keyboard.  I bought the materials 
about two years ago and it has been sitting in my room ever since because I was too 
worried about ruining the case to continue soldering it.

The whole thing had been put in a box and moved to and from school since I have had it, 
but has remained intact.  Each side of the keyboard works by outputting a '1' to a column 
and reading which rows are active.  The sides communicate via a serial connection with 
three pins: GND, VCC and a single data pin.

When I first started the project, I glued the keycaps to the case and soldered the columns 
to the caps.  I was following 
[this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWC_8BOArzc&list=PLJcTwFs4jAY0VnJDXhexZw7X3OIjXQkiY&pp=iAQB)
 build stream, which suggested copper tape for the columns with nonconductive tape on top.  
This worked well, although if I were to make another I would try a different method.  The next 
step is to wire the rows with diodes.  This was especially tedious and took a long time.

The next step is wiring the rows and columns to the microcontroller.  I have Raspberry Pi pro micro 
knockoffs for this project and used dupont connectors for the pins on the micro and on the end of 
row diodes.  For the columns, I soldered the other side of the wire to the copper tape.

I then soldered the pins to the microcontrollers and soldered dupont 
connectors to the RJ-9 jacks.

With that it was about done.  The layoud of the white keys is Colemak and 
the rest is custom; the far bottom left is print screen and far bottom 
right is backslash/pipe.

I successfully flashed the firmware but the right side did not turn on.  
After some debugging, I realized that I ded not flip the wires on the 
RJ-9 jack.  How silly!

After that I had another hour of debugging faulty column connections before it worked.
Great project overall, would recommend
